## [tidyxl](https://nacnudus.github.io/tidyxl/)
tidyxl imports non-tabular data from Excel files into R. It exposes cell content, position, formatting and comments in a tidy structure for further manipulation, especially by the unpivotr package. It supports the xml-based file formats ‘.xlsx’ and ‘.xlsm’ via the embedded RapidXML C++ library. It does not support the binary file formats ‘.xlsb’ or ‘.xls’.

It also provides a function xlex() for tokenizing formulas. See the vignette for details. It is useful for detecting ‘spreadsheet smells’ (poor practice such as embedding constants in formulas, or using deep levels of nesting), and for understanding the dependency structures within spreadsheets
